## Where is the application?

The application can be found [here](https://git.heroku.com/protected-oasis-65326.git).

## How do I add Tokimons to the Database?

In the home page, I use a part of this pages to input a new Tokimon. You can add Tokimon in here.

The names of Tokimon and Trainer are required, while other items default to 0 if there is no input.

The name of Tokimon is unique. If input a Tokimon name which is already exist in database, the database will not add it again.

## How do I delete and edit Tokimons from the Database?

If you want to delete Tokimon from the Databas, firstly you need to click 'Tokimon' in the home pages  and you will see the whole data in the database. Secondly, you need find the Tokimon which you want to delete in the all of Tokimon pages. Click the name of tokimon which you want to delete, and go into this tokimon's details page. In this page, you can click 'Delete This Tokimon' button to delete its. 

And  you also can change the data in this page. However, you just can change the data which except the name of this tokimon because you might as well recreate a new one if you also want to change the name of tokimon.

## What are the extra Features of your app?

Instead of simply JUST having the following:
```sh
1. The ability to add new Tokimon (with corresponding attributes).
2. The ability to change attributes of any of the Tokimons.
3. The ability to delete any of the Tokimons.
4. The ability to display information about a specific Tokimon. A link (Links) should be provided from the Tokimon info page that links to more info.
5. The ability to display all Tokimons currently in the database (including any other information you collect
```

Except these feature, I also add a new feature which is that check the tokimon through the trainer. Click 'Trainer' in the home page, and then input the name of trainer which you want to find. Finally, you can see the tokimon of this trainer.

And I also add a new feature which is show the weight and height for each tokimon in the database. Click 'Display' in the tokimon page, and then it will show the display of each tokimong.
